  <h3>From Khasi Hills to Your Doorstep: The Zizira Way</h3>
  <p>Determined to showcase the agricultural potential of India’s resource-rich North Eastern region, a young team from Shillong in Meghalaya set up Zizira in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>For most of us, indigenous produce like Pepper longum and Bhut Jolokia evoke mesmerising images of the Eastern Himalayas of Northeast India. To a Khasi farmer from Meghalaya, it means hard work, patience and a source of income. A young team from Shillong had a vision to bridge the two and unlock the potential of unique produce from the Northeast to the rest of the world.

     <h3>Impact on local farmers</h3>
 
  <p>Take the case of 53-year-old Gabriel, who lives in Tynriang Village near Shillong. His family owns a patch of farmland along the steep slopes of the forest near his village. He has worked in the farm all his life; first with his father and now with his son. He has seven daughters too, who have all been married off. Now Gabriel lives with his wife and son, and five little girls—granddaughters and nieces.
Providing for his extended family with the produce from his little farmland had become a daily struggle. The family worked from dawn to dusk to make ends meet. Selling his farm produce at the nearest market in Shillong was also a very difficult task, involving arduous treks through the hills, laden with heavy bags.

  <p>More often than not, Gabriel did not find a lot of customers in the market, and had to return with unsold fruits and grains that got wasted in the end. “That was the story of the typical hardships my farming community faced before Zizira entered our lives. Life has changed for the better since then,” shares Gabriel.
